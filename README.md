## Contents of this repo
This repo contains personal C practice problems and experiments. The purpose of these is to expand my own understanding of how certain features of C work and other more general progamming concepts and paradigms. 

I'm a beginner. If you've come across this repo, note that none of this content should be used as reference to proper technique, methodology, style, etc. This is a personal repo made public for others to explore if they so choose. 

## Reflections
Any files labeled `REFLECTIONS.md` contain personal reflections on what I learned while writing that particular program. It might reflect on something broad and general like an overall concept or something specific like a function from a particular library. Hopefully it also includes a bit about key takeaways on how to improve moving forward. All are subject to quite literally terminating mid-sentence as a result of my having ADD and most likely getting distracted by some other trivial thing and moving on, still pushing it to the repo regardless.
